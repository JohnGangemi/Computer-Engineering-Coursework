Compilation:
1. Open the terminal and locate the directory named 'project_two', excluding the '' characters
2. Type the following command in the terminal to create an executable file: make
3. Run the executable file by typing the following command in the terminal: ./run

Notes:
The 'run' program will call upon the 'tlb' program using a function called system and 
pass pre-defined values from the 'run' program as arguments to the 'tlb' program. 
The terminal will execute the programs for some time while displaying the number of 
pages to access from the TLB and the corresponding access time in nanoseconds.
