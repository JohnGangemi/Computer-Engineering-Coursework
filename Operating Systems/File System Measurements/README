Compilation:
1. Open the terminal and locate the directory named 'project5', excluding the '' characters

2. Type the command 'make' in the terminal to create an executable file, again excluding the '' characters

3. Run the executable file by typing the following command in the terminal: ./p5 

Notes:
Execution of the program will 'hang' for 10 seconds initially as this is the time required to test
the accuracy of two timers (rdtsc & gettimeofday). Afterwards, all code snippets will complete and
print their respective results to the terminal.
