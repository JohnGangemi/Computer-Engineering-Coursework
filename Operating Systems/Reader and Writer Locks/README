Compilation:
1. Open the terminal and locate the directory named 'project4', excluding the '' characters

2. Type the command 'make' in the terminal to create an executable file, again excluding the '' characters

3. Run the executable file by typing the following command in the terminal: 
   ./rwlock <# of reader threads> <# of writer threads>

   Example: ./rwlock 4 3 (statement would create 4 readers and 3 writers)

Notes:
The "rwlock" program accepts 2 command line arguments and will terminate appropriately
if the condition is not satisfied.
