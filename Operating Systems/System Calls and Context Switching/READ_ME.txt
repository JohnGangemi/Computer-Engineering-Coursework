Compilation:
***System Calls***
1. Open the terminal and locate the folder: Project One / System Call 
2. Type the following command in the terminal to create an object file: make
3. Run the object file by typing the following command in the terminal: ./system_call

***Context Switching***
1. Open the terminal and locate the folder: Project One / Context Switching
2. Type the following command in the terminal to create an object file: make
3. Run the object file by typing the following command in the terminal: ./context_switch

Notes:
The System Call program requests user input in the form of an integer when prompted.
Expected value range is anywhere from 1 to infinity, however a user value greater
than 1000 will ensure convergence on the average system call time in microseconds.

Multiple runs of the Context Switch program will provide the user with an estimate
of the average context switching time performed by their host machine.
