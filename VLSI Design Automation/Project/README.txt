HOW TO USE OUR PROGRAM

Executables Paths:
Debug = Final Design Project/Parser_WFA/bin/Debug/Parser_WFA.exe
Release = Final Design Project/Parser_WFA/bin/Release/Parser_WFA.exe

Requirements:
.NET Framework 4.5 
Padframe file(.lib)
Standard Cell library (.lib)
Netlist files (.netlblif, .netblif) 

Notes:
If the project does not import correctly with Visual Studio then manual copy-paste of program
files is necessary.

The program will open a console and GUI. Use the GUI to access the design files, whereas the console
is meant to provide runtime output. Closing the console will also close the GUI!

ATTENTION:
This program implements the 'La Brute Forche' therefore it is recommended that netlist files 
under 30KB are only used. Unless you feel like running a 5K, grabbing lunch and then watching a movie 
before checking if program execution has finished.
